# Tmate SSH server operator
<!-- Use this space for badges -->

A Juju charm that provides the self-hosted GitHub runner an integration with self-hosted SSH debug
server. The self-hosted SSH debug server is automatically available via the forked version of 
[action-tmate](https://github.com/canonical/action-tmate). By default, the connection is allowed
only for the actor of the debug workflow for security considerations. This charm is deployed as a
VM.

Like any Juju charm, this charm supports one-line deployment, integration, scaling, and more. For
Charmed Tmate SSH server, there are no configurations required and the charm works out of the box.

For information about how to deploy, integrate, and manage this charm, see the Official 
[CharmHub Documentation](https://charmhub.io/tmate-ssh-server).
