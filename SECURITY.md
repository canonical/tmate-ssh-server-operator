# Security policy

## What qualifies as a security issue

Credentials leakage, outdated dependencies with known vulnerabilities, and
other issues that could lead to unprivileged or unauthorised access to the
database or the system.

## Reporting a vulnerability

The easiest way to report a security issue is through GitHub.
See [Privately reporting a security
vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
for instructions.

The repository admins will be notified of the issue and will work with you
to determine whether the issue qualifies as a security issue and, if so, in
which component. We will then handle figuring out a fix, getting a CVE
assigned and coordinating the release of the fix.

The [Ubuntu Security disclosure and embargo policy](https://ubuntu.com/security/disclosure-policy)
contains more information about what you can expect when you contact us, and what we
expect from you.

## Vulnerability scanning

The `Secscan` workflow scans the published charm (`latest/edge` on 22.04 and 24.04,
`latest/stable`) and the `ghcr.io/canonical/tmate-ssh-server` image the charm runs, using
Canonical's secscan service (Trivy). It runs after every publish to edge, weekly, and on
demand, and fails when it finds a CVE that is not excluded.

When it fails, maintainers download the `secscan-report-*` artifacts and either fix the
issue or open a draft [GitHub security advisory](../../security/advisories/new) recording
the CVE, its severity and the remediation plan. A CVE accepted as a false positive or
acceptable risk is added to `.github/secscan-exclusions/<artifact>.txt` with a
justification comment and a link to its advisory. High or critical exclusions need
security team approval. The SSDLC cycle is set by `SSDLC_CYCLE` in the workflow and must
be bumped each cycle.
