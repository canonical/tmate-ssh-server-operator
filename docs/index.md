<!-- vale Canonical.007-Headings-sentence-case = YES -->

A [Juju](https://juju.is/) [charm](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/3.6/reference/charm/)
deploying and managing [Tmate self-hosted server](https://github.com/tmate-io/tmate). tmate is an
open source terminal multiplexer, providing instant terminal sharing capabilities.

Tmate enables users to share their terminal session with other users over the internet, allowing
them to collaborate, provide technical support, or demonstrate commands and procedures in
real-time.

This charm provides the tmate SSH server service, which is paired with the tmate client to provide
a self-hosted SSH relay server.

For DevOps and SRE teams, this charm will make operating self hosted tmate SSH server simple and
straightforward through Juju's clean interface. Allowing machine relations to the
[Github runner](https://charmhub.io/github-runner), it supports SSH debug access to the runner VMs
managed by the charm.
